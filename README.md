# OKCAnalytics

## Summary

**Project Overview: Automating Sports Analytics and Engagement**

1. **Automate Data Collection and Analysis**:
   - Utilize sports APIs (e.g., NBA API) to gather real-time data and write Python scripts for analyzing player and team performance.
   - Implement task schedulers to automate data processing after each game, ensuring consistent and timely insights.

2. **Content Creation and Posting**:
   - Automatically generate social media posts with summaries of game statistics and visualizations (e.g., player shot charts) using text templates.
   - Leverage Twitter and Facebook APIs for direct posting, and consider using tools like Buffer for scheduling posts. Set up automated responses to engage with audience.

3. **Periodic Publications**:
   - Create a periodic publication summarizing your findings.

4. **Data Dashboards**:
   - Develop interactive data dashboards to visualize team and player statistics using tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or BI tools (e.g., Power BI, Tableau). These dashboards will enhance user engagement and provide real-time updates.

5. **Web Application Development**:
   - Build a personal web app to house analyses, publications, and dashboards, allowing easy access for users to explore findings. This app can serve as a centralized platform for all sports analytics content.

6. **Learning and Community Engagement Plan**:
   - Start by collecting and analyzing data, sharing insights, and visualizations on social media.
   - Progress to predictive modeling and API development, culminating in the deployment of your web app.
   - Regularly publish findings, share updates on GitHub and social media, and engage with audience to build a following.

6. **Automate, Rinse, and Repeat**:
   - Once OKCAnalytics is built and automated, the process can be duplicated for other teams, becoming a national endeavuer.
