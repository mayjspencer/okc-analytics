# OKCAnalytics

## Summary

**Project Overview: Automating Sports Analytics and Engagement**

1. **Automate Data Collection and Analysis**:
   - Utilize sports APIs (e.g., NBA API) to gather real-time data and write Python scripts for analyzing player and team performance.
   - Implement task schedulers to automate data processing after each game, ensuring consistent and timely insights.

2. **Content Creation and Posting**:
   - Automatically generate social media posts with summaries of game statistics and visualizations (e.g., player shot charts) using text templates.
   - Provide useful information!!
   - Leverage Twitter and Facebook APIs for direct posting, and consider using tools like Buffer for scheduling posts. Set up automated responses to engage with audience.

3. **Periodic Publications**:
   - Create a periodic publication summarizing your findings.

4. **Data Dashboards**:
   - Develop interactive data dashboards to visualize team and player statistics using tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or BI tools (e.g., Power BI, Tableau). These dashboards will enhance user engagement and provide real-time updates.

5. **Web Application Development**:
   - Build a personal web app to house analyses, publications, and dashboards, allowing easy access for users to explore findings. This app can serve as a centralized platform for all sports analytics content.

6. **Learning and Community Engagement Plan**:
   - Start by collecting and analyzing data, sharing insights, and visualizations on social media.
   - Progress to predictive modeling and API development, culminating in the deployment of your web app.
   - Regularly publish findings, share updates on GitHub and social media, and engage with audience to build a following.

6. **Automate, Rinse, and Repeat**:
   - Once OKCAnalytics is built and automated, the process can be duplicated for other teams, becoming a national endeavuer.

## Plan

**Phase 1: Set Up Your Foundation**

1. **Learn Version Control**:
   - **Create a GitHub Account**: Sign up at GitHub and set up your profile.
   - **Repository Setup**: 
     - Create a new repository named `sports-analytics-project`.
     - Add a clear `README.md` file explaining the project goals and structure.
     - Familiarize yourself with basic Git commands (clone, commit, push, pull).

2. **Data Collection Basics**:
   - **Install Necessary Tools**: Set up Python and install libraries like `requests`, `Pandas`, and `Matplotlib`.
   - **Familiarize Yourself with APIs**: Read the documentation for sports APIs (e.g., NBA API) and write simple scripts to fetch data.

**Phase 2: Data Analysis and Visualization**

3. **Analyze Data**:
   - **Data Manipulation**: Use `Pandas` to create DataFrames and perform basic operations to analyze player statistics and game data.
   - **Create Visualizations**: Use `Matplotlib` to create charts and graphs that visually represent the data (e.g., player performance over time).

4. **Engage on Social Media**:
   - Develop a content calendar to post findings and visualizations regularly on social media (e.g., Twitter, Instagram).
   - Create engaging posts summarizing key insights from your analyses.

**Phase 5: Automation of Content Posting**

5. **Automate Posting to Social Media**:
   - **Use Social Media APIs**: Learn how to use APIs for Twitter and Instagram to automate posting.
   - Develop scripts that can:
     - Schedule posts based on your content calendar.
     - Automatically upload images and text summaries after games or when new analyses are completed.
   - Set up automated notifications for engaging content to respond to comments or interact with followers.

6. **Monitor Engagement**:
   - Track engagement metrics on your social media posts (likes, shares, comments).
   - Use this data to refine your content strategy and improve engagement over time.

**Phase 3: Advanced Analytics and Publications**

7. **Develop Predictive Models**:
   - **Learn Basic Machine Learning**: Study introductory machine learning concepts through online courses.
   - Implement simple models to predict player performance based on historical data.

8. **Create a Periodic Publication**:
   - Compile your analyses into a structured document (e.g., a 30-page PDF summarizing insights on the OKC 2023 season).
   - Use tools like LaTeX or Google Docs for formatting and organizing your publication.
   - Consider including key statistics, trends, and visualizations in the publication.

**Phase 4: Dashboards and Web App Development**

9. **Build Interactive Dashboards**:
   - **Learn Dashboard Tools**: Explore Tableau or Power BI to create interactive visualizations.
   - Publish your dashboards online and share the links on your social media accounts to engage your audience.

10. **Develop Your Web App**:
   - **Learn Basic Web Development**: Familiarize yourself with Flask or Django to create a simple web application.
   - The web app should display your analyses, visualizations, and provide downloadable content (e.g., the periodic publication).
  

**Phase 6: Continuous Improvement and Engagement**

11. **Iterate and Improve**:
   - Regularly update your analyses based on new data and refine your predictive models.
   - Share your findings and updates consistently to maintain audience engagement.

12. **Engage with Your Community**:
   - Foster relationships with your audience by responding to comments, conducting polls, and encouraging discussions.
   - Consider joining online communities focused on sports analytics to share your work and learn from others.

13. **Continuous Improvement in Machine Learning and Advanced Analysis**
   - **Skills**: Advanced ML techniques (neural networks with TensorFlow or PyTorch)
   - **Application**: Develop and refine predictive models to analyze more complex questions.
   - **Action**: Share new findings and models as your skills advance, and keep refining your analytics portfolio to highlight your growth.

14. **Backend Development and API Creation**
   - **Skills**: Flask or Django, REST API development
   - **Application**: Build an API that others could use to query your sports data analysis.
   - **Action**: Share this API on GitHub and announce it on your social media with a demo.

15. **Cloud Hosting and Deployment**
   - **Skills**: AWS or Azure, containerization with Docker
   - **Application**: Deploy your sports analytics project as a web app, so others can access your analysis and models.
